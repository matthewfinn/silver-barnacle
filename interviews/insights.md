## Production Line Developers
Too many developers act like they work on an assembly line.
They wait around for detailed requirements.
Their version of "done" ends when they commit code.
They don't think about the user experience.
Great developers own the entire product cycle.
They ask clarifying questions to understand the "why" behind the task.
They test thoroughly and take responsibility for production.
Software development isn't manufacturing widgets.
The best developers understand that their job isn't to write code.
Their job is to solve problems.
The code is just one part of the solution.

## Work/Life Balance & Culture
Working extra hours is fine — if it's your choice or occasional to meet a tight project deadline .
The moment it feels forced or expected, it’s time to re-evaluate the environment you're in.
Remember that the reason you are doing this is to make your life better

## Rockstars
You don't need rockstar engineers. You need rockstar requirements and a band of average engineers.
Most of us are building really simple software.
We display some data, save it to a database, call an API, etc.  
It's not SpaceX rocket science, self driving cars, or ChatGPT.
What you need is really good requirements, some basic software architecture to follow, and a team to hammer out the features.
With good requirements, you can make a bunch of average engineers look like rockstars and produce #1 hits

## Overengineering
Usually you shouldn't roll your own:
- search algorithm
- encryption
- auth
- credit card handling
- billing
- caching systems
- logging framework
- csv parsing
- html parsing
- URL parsing
- JSON/XML parsing
- floating point math
- timezones library
- localization
- internationalization
- postal address handling
  Do it to learn, to get an appreciation of how hard the domain is.
  But please don't put it in production unless you have a really, really, really good reason.

## Knowledge
Engineers are not encyclopedias.
Engineers are problem solvers.
Engineers NEED people, docs, Stack Overflow, search engines and even AI to write good code.
Engineers MUST ask questions and collaborate to build great software.

## Code Coverage
The question: "What is an acceptable percentage level of test coverage."
The answer: "Look at whether the risky bits of code are covered. Striving for a percentage just leads to noise. Between unit and integration tests, the percentage of coverage becomes a misleading measurement. Rather make sure the tests cover important functionality that won't break in an obvious way."

## Culture
Company culture is not words on the wall, free pizza or even flexible working arrangements
It's how people feel on a Sunday night.

## TDD
TDD forces you to be very specific upfront about _what_ you want to achieve. And that feels like less fun and more effort than diving in and coding a solution. It takes mental effort.
Why, then, do some people love TDD so much?
It’s because that initial investment of self-discipline pays off. And the return on investment is huge. Problems are easier to solve if you are clear and specific about what the issue actually is.

## Seniority
Seniority is about impact moreso than anything else, but also includes mentoring & stepping in where necessary

## Scheduling 
We can do it now OR we can do it right!

## System Design
If you don’t have a good grasp of the universe of what’s possible, you can’t design a good system

# Write A Work Log
A work log is a document that contains the list of tasks you accomplished. The granularity and the type of tasks don’t matter, as long as you keep track of what you did.

Useful for performance reviews, resume
