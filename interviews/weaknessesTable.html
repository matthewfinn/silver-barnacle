    <tr>
        <td>Delegation</td>
        <td>I sometimes take on too much myself instead of delegating, especially when I want to ensure quality. I’ve been working on trusting the process and sharing ownership.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Presentation skills</td>
        <td>I tend to get a bit nervous presenting to large groups, but I’ve been pushing myself in smaller settings and gradually building more confidence.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Perfectionism</td>
        <td>I like to get things just right, which can mean I spend longer than necessary on details. I’m learning to balance that with efficiency and context.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Public speaking</td>
        <td>It’s not my natural strength, but I’m working on being clearer and more concise when speaking in meetings or demos.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Letting go of control</td>
        <td>After working in a lead role, I’ve had to remind myself that stepping back is part of good teamwork. I’m focusing more on enabling others rather than doing it all.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Not the biggest fan of coding</td>
        <td>While I can code and have done so professionally, I’ve realized I prefer the testing, analysis, and quality-focused side of software.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Getting bogged down in technical details</td>
        <td>I like to understand things fully, which can sometimes mean diving deep. I’m learning to keep the bigger picture in mind, especially when prioritizing tasks.</td>
