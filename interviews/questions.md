# Tell me about yourself
I started my career in quality assurance, working on a mix of manual and automated testing across web, Android, and backend systems. This gave me a solid foundation in testing strategies, as well as experience with tools like Nightwatch.js and performance testing with Locust.

Over time, I transitioned into software engineering roles, where I worked on Android development, API integrations, system troubleshooting, and release planning. I also spent some time in a lead role, managing and mentoring engineers, as well as driving project delivery by acting as a scrum master for 2 different project teams across multiple teams.

In 2024, I decided to step back and work on my family business, where I handled customer communications via email, some website administration tasks and contributed to construction-related work at our premises and on-site with customers. This time allowed me to reflect on my career path, and I realized I wanted to return to a role with a stronger focus on QA—an area I'm eager to grow in.

While my software development experience was valuable, I’ve found that I’m most passionate about ensuring software quality—particularly in testing APIs, improving testing processes, and identifying issues early. That’s why I’m now focused on returning to a dedicated QA role, where I can combine my testing background with my development knowledge to contribute to high-quality, reliable software.

## Dealing with Conflict
* No need to be confrontational
* Explain your point of view and why you don't agree with the person clearly
* Talk instead of type
* High quality bug reports
  * Be precise in the defect description
  * Include all relevant evidence
  * Explain as simply and clearly as possible 
* Conflict is over a work item generally and not with a person
* If you're unsure about something seek a review
* Is there a potential for a compromise that satisfies both points of view
* If required get someone to mediate i.e. manager, scrum master, product owner

### Example of a time I had a conflict
Honestly a rare occurrence of any hostile conflict in my career as I generally have the ability to get along with everyone even when our viewpoints differ.
* Root cause of issues lay with other teams 
  * Gathered evidence and concisely present in person (or on a call) rather than creating hostility with calling people out on a ticket
* Conflict with 3rd party provider of MDM
  * 
* 100 point estimation from engineer - resolved conflict by asking them to list out the risks they saw to justify and asked for clarifications
* Code Review Disagreements
  * Hopped on a call, explained the design decisions and the reasons for which and why xyz wouldn't work within the required project timeline and made some compromises

## Above & Beyond
* CAELD run-in, weekend work
* Switchover evening/weekend work & on-call
* T3 roadmap - weekend work
* Regularly stepped in for software managers & directors during planned and unforseen absenses 

## Introduction of new Processes
* UAT process
* Code review process due to bug slip
  * Tech leads CC'd, 2 approvals
* 

## Projects I'm proud of 
* T3 roadmap increased stability
  * Through analysis of issues
  * All delivered on schedule with massive improvements to system reliability
* CAELD switchover process
  * Needed to engineer a solution to switch drivers from one compliance app to another ensuring all data migration was completed and the downtime was only a number of minutes while they were on a break in a depot or a truck stop.
* Android OS Compatibility Upgrades
  * Key was that the upgrades were as low impact as possible as Truck drivers really disliked doing anything out of the ordinary with their tablets


## Dealing with Pressure
* Prioritization and Time Management
  * Break down tasks into smaller, manageable parts
  * Focus on high-priority tasks that align with project goals
  * Use tools like Jira to keep track of progress and deadlines
* Clear communication with stakeholders
  * Set realistic expectations about timelines and potential delays 
  * Insist that a priority be called on the items if necessary
  * Open lines of communication with stakeholders, including managers, team members, and client
* Collaboration
  * Work closely with teammates to brainstorm solutions when facing roadblocks
  * Pair programming, code reviews, and collaboration can help reduce the pressure of solving issues alone
* Taking short breaks to reset, 
  * come back with a fresh perspective
* Stay organised
  * Organize tasks by urgency and importance
  * GitLab, Jira updated, a personal to do list etc.
  * Make use of version control systems (e.g., Git) to avoid major mistakes under pressure
* Continuous Learning
  * Stay up-to-date with new technologies and best practices to prevent being overwhelmed by unfamiliar tools or techniques
  * Seek out mentorship or training to help with skills gaps that may contribute to feeling pressure
* Ask for help if it's needed

> When dealing with pressure, I focus on prioritizing tasks and breaking them down into smaller, manageable steps. Clear communication with my team and stakeholders is key to managing expectations. I also stay organized with tools like Jira to keep track of progress. When things get overwhelming, I make sure to take short breaks to clear my head and reset, which helps me maintain focus and reduce stress.

## Reasons for Leaving last role
I left my last role in 2024. I realised that the people management aspects of the role weren’t the best fit for me, and I wasn’t enjoying that part of the job. After spending so many years in that company, it felt like a good time for a change. I took some time to work on my family business, where I managed email and website administration tasks and also contributed to construction-related work. This experience gave me the opportunity to reflect on my career direction. I realised I wanted to return to a role with a stronger focus on QA, an area I’m eager to learn more about and grow in. Additionally, the culture in my previous role involved a lot of out-of-hours and unpaid overtime, which affected my work-life balance. I’m now seeking a role that offers both a better work-life balance and the opportunity to grow within QA.


## Salary
Since I’m transitioning from a senior engineering role, I understand QA has its own salary expectations, and I’m not looking to match my previous pay. For a mid-level QA role in Ireland, I think something around €45,000 to €65,000 makes sense, depending on the scope. I also bring some added value from my dev background, especially with test automation and understanding how things are built. At this stage, I’m also looking for a role that offers a good balance — something rewarding but sustainable long-term with scope for progression.

## Questions for Potential Employer
* Onboarding Structure
* Approach to test case identification
* Release cadence
* Team structure
* Training and progression
* Technologies used 
* Current automation setup details

## What is Shift-Left Testing?
> "Shift-Left Testing refers to the practice of involving testing early in the software development lifecycle, rather than waiting until later stages like the end of development or post-production. The goal is to detect and address issues as soon as possible, during the requirements, design, and coding phases, which leads to better quality, reduced costs, and quicker releases."

## Why is Shift-Left Beneficial?
> "Shift-Left Testing helps identify issues early, preventing them from escalating into more expensive and time-consuming problems later. It allows teams to fix defects sooner, which ultimately leads to more reliable software, fewer bugs, and faster delivery. It also encourages collaboration between developers, testers, and other stakeholders early in the process, promoting a shared responsibility for quality."

## How Do You Approach Shift-Left Testing?
> "In my experience, I’ve implemented Shift-Left practices by involving QA early in the development cycle. For example, I work closely with developers during the design and coding phases to define test cases based on user stories or features. Additionally, I focus on automating tests as early as possible, creating unit and integration tests that can be executed during the development phase, to catch bugs before they make it into later stages. By catching issues earlier, we reduce rework and improve the overall quality of the software."
