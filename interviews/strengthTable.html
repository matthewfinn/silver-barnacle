    <tr>
        <th>Strength</th>
        <th>Expanded Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Strong QA and development background</td>
        <td>I started in QA and later worked in software development, which gives me a solid technical base and a strong understanding of how to test software effectively from multiple angles.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>API testing and troubleshooting</td>
        <td>I’ve worked extensively with APIs—testing them, integrating them, and resolving issues when things go wrong. I enjoy digging into logs and requests to figure out root causes.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Manual and automated testing experience</td>
        <td>I’m comfortable writing manual test cases as well as building out automated suites. I’ve used tools like Nightwatch.js and integrated tests into Jenkins pipelines for CI/CD.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Strong attention to edge cases and quality</td>
        <td>I naturally look for edge cases and scenarios others might miss. I like being the person who asks, ‘What happens if…?’—it’s part of what drew me back toward QA.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>CI/CD and modern testing tools</td>
        <td>I’ve worked with CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, and tools like Locust for performance testing. I enjoy finding ways to improve release reliability and speed through better testing.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Collaboration with cross-functional teams</td>
        <td>In my previous role, I worked closely with developers, support, and even cybersecurity teams across different time zones. I’m comfortable navigating different teams to get things done.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Problem-solving mindset</td>
        <td>Whether it’s troubleshooting an issue or figuring out how to improve a test process, I like working through problems step by step to find practical solutions.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Customer-focused approach</td>
        <td>Even in technical roles, I’ve always kept the end user in mind. My experience in support and onboarding gave me insight into how software impacts real users—and how QA plays a big role.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Ability to learn new technologies quickly</td>
        <td>I’ve had to ramp up on a variety of tools and technologies throughout my career, and I’m comfortable picking things up fast—whether it’s a new framework, testing tool, or API standard.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Adaptability</td>
        <td>I’ve worked in fast-paced environments where priorities shift quickly. I’m able to adapt to new challenges, whether that means learning a new domain or adjusting to team changes.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Able to multitask effectively</td>
        <td>In my past roles, I’ve often balanced development work, QA support, and cross-team coordination at the same time. I’m used to juggling multiple responsibilities without losing focus.</td>
