# make install logs more readable
``npm install --loglevel=warn --color=always 2>&1 | less -R``

* ``--loglevel=warn`` This tells NPM to only show warnings and errors, skipping all the usual info-level noise like:
* ``--color=always`` Forces NPM to use colored output (even when piping). This is important because by default, NPM disables color if it thinks the output is being redirected to something that doesnâ€™t support it.
* ``2>&1`` This merges stderr (2) into stdout (1). 
  * Why? Because:
    * NPM prints errors to stderr 
    * If you want to pipe all output (both normal + error) into something (like less), you need to combine them.
**Possibly better without the below**
* ``| less -R`` This takes the combined output and pipes it into less, a pager that lets you scroll up and down easily. The -R flag tells less to interpret raw ANSI color codes, so the color from --color=always is preserved.
