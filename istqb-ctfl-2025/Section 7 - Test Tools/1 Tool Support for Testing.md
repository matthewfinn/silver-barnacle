# Tool Support for Testing
* Why use tools?
  * People are good at certain things & less good at other things
  * Computers are good at certain things & less good at other things
  * Create a more reliable & efficient process by harnessing the talents of both people & computers

* Tools can be classified on purpose, pricing, licensing, technology, etc.
* Some tools are specialized in one activity; others support more than one
* If tools from a single provider work together, they might be provided as an integrated suite

**Probe effect** = A tool that measures some aspect of software might have unexpected side effects on that software & the measured aspect

## Purpose of using Tools in Testing
* What can tools be used for?
  * Directly in testing
  * Managing the test process
  * Investigation & evaluation
  * Aid in 

* What is the purpose of tool support?
  * Improve efficiency through automation
  * Improve efficiency of test activities by supporting manual test activities
  * Improve the quality of test activities â€“ more consistent & higher level of defect reproducibility
  * Automate activities that can not be done manually
  * Increase reliability of testing

## Test Tool Classification
### Management Tools
* Increase the test process efficiency by facilitating management of the SDLC, requirements, tests, defects, configuration
* Examples: Jira, Azure DevOps

### Static Testing Tools
* Support the tester in performing reviews & static analysis
* Example: Sonarqube

### Test Design & Implementation Tools
* Facilitate generation of test cases, test data & test procedures
* Example: Selenium, Playwright, Cypress, TestComplete, Ranorex

### Test Execution & Coverage Tools
* Facilitate automated test execution & coverage measurement
* Examples: Azure DevOps, Jenkins, Sonarqube

### Non-functional Test Tools
* Allow the tester to perform non-functional testing that is difficult or impossible to perform manually
* Examples: Load Runner, BlazeMeter, Locust, JMeter

### DevOps Tools
* Support the DevOps delivery pipeline, workflow tracking, automated build process(es), CI/CD 
* Examples: Jenkins, Azure DevOps

### Collaboration tools
* Facilitate communication
* Examples: Zoom, MS Teams, Slack

### Tools Supporting Scalability & Deployment Standardisation
* Virtual machines, containerization tools
* Examples: Citrix Hypervisor, Kubernetes, Docker

### Any Other Tool that assists in Testing!!!

## Benefits & Risks of Test Automation
### Potential Benefits of using Tools
Acquisition of a tool for automated test execution does not guarantee success. Effort is required to achieve real & lasting benefits

Potential benefits include:
* Reduction of repetitive manual work
* Greater consistency & repeatability
* More objective assessment
* Ease of access to information about tests or testing
* Reduced test execution time
* More time for testers to create better tests

### Potential Risks of using Tools
* Unrealistic expectations
* Underestimating the time, cost & effort involved for the introduction, use & maintenance
* Underestimating the effort to maintain the test assets generated by the tool
* Over-reliance on the tool
* Failing to use proper configuration management for the test assets
* Relationships & interoperability between critical tools may be overlooked or neglected
* Possibility that the vendor goes out of business or provide inadequate support
* Open source project might be suspended
* The automation tool is incompatible with the development platform
* A tool is chosen that does not comply with regulatory or safety standards

## Considerations for Test Execution & Test Management Tools
### Points of Consideration â€“ Test Execution Tools
* Requires significant effort to achieve significant benefit
* Linear scripts are not stable nor maintainable â€“ â€˜smartâ€™ image capturing technology is an improvement
* Data-driven approach separates the test input (data) from the test script; testers without scripting knowledge can create the test data for the predefined scripts
* Keyword-driven approach separates the test input & actions (keywords); testers without scripting knowledge can then create tests using the keywords & the test data
* Model-based testing tools enables a functional specification to be captured as a model (i.e. activity diagram) which the tool then interprets & creates test case specifications, which can be saved in a test management tool & executed by a test execution tool.

### Points of Consideration â€“ Test Management Tools
* Often needs to interface with other tools in order to:
  * Produce useful information in a useful format
  * Maintain consistent traceability to requirements in a requirement management tool
  * Link with test object version information in the configuration management tool
* Particularly important when using an integrated tool that is used by different groups in the organisation

## Effective use of Tools
### Selection
* You should not change processes to fit the tool, but choose the tool to fulfil the need of the organisation
* Factors that should be taken into account when selecting a tool:
<table>
   <tr>
      <td>Organisation's maturity</td>
      <td>Evaluation of the vendor</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>Identification of opportunities for an improved test process with tools</td>
      <td>Identification of internal requirements for coaching and mentoring</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>Understanding of the technologies used by the test object</td>
      <td>Evaluation of training needs</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>Build & CI tools already used</td>
      <td>Pros and cons of various licensing models</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>Evaluation of the tool against clear requirements & objectives</td>
      <td>Estimation of cost-benefit ratio</td>
   </tr>
</table>

* Proof-of-concept to prove the tool works with the test object and in the infrastructure, or not...

## Introducing a Tool into an Organisation â€“ Pilot
* A pilot project has the following objectives:
  * Gain in/depth knowledge about the tool / its strengths & weaknesses
  * Evaluate how the tool would fit with existing processes & practices
  * Determine which changes are needed
  * Decide on standard ways of using, managing, storing and maintaining the tool & test assets
  * Assess whether the benefits will be achieved at reasonable cost
  * Understand the metrics you wish the tool to collect & report & configure the tool to make sure these metrics can be captured & reported on

## Introducing a Tool into an Organisation â€“ Success Factors
* Roll-out incrementally
* Adapt & improve processes, testware & artifacts to get proper balance
* Provide support, training, coaching & mentoring for new users
* Define usage guidelines
* Gather usage information from the actual use of the tool
* Implement a continuous improvement mechanism
* Monitor the use of the tool & benefits
* Provide continuing support to the users
* Gather lessons learned from all teams
* Should be technically & organisationally integrated into the SDLC

## Keywords
* **Test Automation** - The use of software to perform or support test activities
* **Test Automation Strategy** - A high-level plan to achieve long-term objectives of test automation under given boundary conditions

Testing is a craft
With tools you can better do that craft
Testing is MUCH more than test automation
Focus on learning how to be a good tester first!
