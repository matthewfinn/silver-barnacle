# Static vs Dynamic Testing

| Static Testing                                                                                  | Dynamic Testing                                                                                 |

| Finds **defects** in work products                                                              | Finds **failures** caused by defects when running the software                                  |
| Used to improve the **consistency** and **internal quality**                                    | Focuses on **externally visible** behaviour                                                      |
| Quality characteristics **not** depending on executing code (code quality, maintainability,etc) | Quality characteristics depending on executing code (performance efficiency,functionality, etc) |


### Typical defects found in Static Testing
Typical defects that are easier and cheaper to find with static testing compared to dynamic testing:
* Requirement defects
* Design defects
* Coding defects
* Deviations from standards
* Incorrect interface specifications
* Security vulnerabilities
* Gaps or inaccuracies in test basis traceability or coverage
* Most maintainability defects can only be found by static testing
