# Metrics used for Testing
## Defining & Using Test Metrics
**â€˜What doesnâ€™t get measured, doesnâ€™t get doneâ€™**

* Testing metrics categories:
  * **Project** metrics - progress towards project exit criteria
  * **Product** metrics - attribute of the product
  * **Process** metrics - capability of the process
  * **People** metrics - capability of individuals or groups

## Metrics used for Testing
* Test Metrics can be collected at the end of any test activity to assess:
  * Progress against the planned schedule & budget
  * Current quality of the test object
  * Adequacy of the test approach
  * Effectiveness of the test activities with respect to the objectives
* Mainly gathered in Test Monitoring to support Test Control & Test Completion

### Common Test Metrics

#### Test Metrics - Considerations
* Metrics must frequently be reported to various stakeholders
* As metrics are used to determine the overall project success, the following must be considered:
  * Definition of metrics
  * Tracking of metrics
  * Reporting of metrics
  * Validity of metrics

#### Definition of Metrics
* A limited set of useful metrics should be defined
* Metrics should be based on specific objectives for the process, product or product
* Metrics should be defined for balance (as a whole)
* Interpretation of the defined metrics must be agreed upon by all stakeholders
* Often too many metrics are defined instead of the most useful ones

#### Tracking of Metrics
* Reporting & merging metrics should be as much automated as possible
* Variations of measurements over time may differ from the agreed upon interpretation
* Possible differences between reality & expectations should be analysed as well as the reasons for these differences

#### Reporting of Metrics
* Objective is to provide an immediate understanding of the information, for management purposes
* Presentations may show:
  * A snapshot of a metric at a certain point in time
  * The evolution of a metric over time so that trends can be evaluated

#### Validity of Metrics
* The information that is being reported must be verified:
  * Measurement taken for a metric may not reflect the true status
  * Measurement taken for a metric may convey an overly positive or negative trend
* Before any data is presented, it should be reviewed for:
  * Accuracy
  * The message that it is likely to convey
