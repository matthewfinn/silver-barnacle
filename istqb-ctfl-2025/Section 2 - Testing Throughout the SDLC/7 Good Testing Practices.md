# Testing in a life cycle model

Whichever development model is used, the below is always the case:
* For each development activity there is a corresponding testing activity;
* Each test level has test objectives specific to that level;
* Test analysis and design of tests for a given test level should begin during the corresponding development activity;
* Testers should be involved in reviewing documents as soon as drafts are available in the development cycle.
