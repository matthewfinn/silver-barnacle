# DevOps and Testing

### What is DevOps?
* DevOps is an Agile approach
* Removing the silos between development and operations 
* Working together towards achieving a set of common goals 
* There are no separate agendas for development and operations 
* Implementation requires an organizational and cultural shift 
* All functions are treated with equal value 
* The team has full autonomy

### Why DevOps?
* Team autonomy
* Everyone on the same page
* Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD)
  * Build, Test & Release **high quality** software quickly through DevOps delivery pipelines
* Fast feedback loops in all phases
  * Code built with unit tests
  * Code coverage measured with each check-in
  * Faster and better view on non-functional quality characteristics
  * Faster releases mean fast feedback from customers

### Benefits of DevOps on Testing
* Fast feedback on the code quality (new features and regression)
* Shift-left approach in testing is promoted
  * Checking in high quality code
  * Unit tests
  * Static analysis
* CI/CD processes create stable environments
* Better view on non-functional quality characteristic
* Need for repetitive manual testing is reduced through automated testing and delivery pipelines
* Minimised risk in regression through automation

### Risks of DevOps on Testing
* Define and establish the CI/CD Pipelines
* CI/CD Tools implementation and maintenance
* Test Automation requires additional resources
