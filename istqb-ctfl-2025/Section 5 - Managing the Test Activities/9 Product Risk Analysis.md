# Product Risk Analysis
## Risk-Based Testing & Product Quality
* Risk is used to focus effort required during testing
  * Where and when to start testing
  * Which areas need more attention
* Testing is used to:
  * Reduce the likelihood of a negative event occurring
  * Reduce the impact of a negative event occurring
  * Mitigate risk
  * Provide feedback about identified risks
  * Providing feedback on unresolved risks
* Risk-based testing:
  * Can reduce the levels of product risk in an early stage in the SDLC
  * Includes **product risk analysis**
    * Identifies product risks
    * Assesses the likelihood and impact of each risk
  * Product risk information is used to guide:
    * Test Planning
    * The specification, preparation and execution of test cases
    * Test monitoring and control
* Product Risk Analysis can influence the scope and the thoroughness of testing
* In **risk-based** testing, the results of **product risk analysis** are used to:
  * Determine the scope of testing to be carried out
  * Determine the particular test levels and propose test types to be performed
  * Determine the test techniques to be used and the coverage to be achieved
  * Estimate the test effort required for each task
  * Prioritise testing in an attempt to find critical defects as early as possible
  * Determine whether other activities besides testing should be carried out to reduce risk
* Collective knowledge and insight of the project stakeholders is used for product risk analysis
* Minimising the likelihood of a product failure, risk management provides a disciplined approach to:
  * Analyse risks
  * Determine which risks are important to deal with
  * Implement actions to mitigate those risks
  * Make contingency plans to deal with the risks should they become actual events
* Testing may
  * Identify new risks
  * Help to determine what risks should be mitigated
  * Lower uncertainty about risks

## Product Risk Analysis
* Goal â€“ Provide awareness of product risks
  * Focus testing efforts to minimize the residual level of product risk.
* Should start early in the SDLC
* Consists of two main activities
