### What is Risk?

**â€˜A potential event, hazard, threat or situation whose occurrence causes an adverse effectâ€™**

Risk is characterised by two factors:

* Risk **likelihood**
  * â€˜The probability of the risk occurrenceâ€™ (greater than zero & less than 1)
* Risk **impact**
  * â€˜The consequences of this occurrenceâ€™ â€“ the harm

### Risk Level

* A measure for the risk
  * The higher the risk level, the more important the treatment
* A calculated result from the combination of:
  * Risk Likelihood (greater than zero & smaller than one)
  * Risk Impact

### Risk Likelihood

**â€˜The probability of the risk occurrenceâ€™**

Factors that influence the likelihood include:

<table>
   <tr>
      <td>Complexity</td>
      <td>Weak leadership</td>

   <tr>
      <td>Tools & technology</td>
