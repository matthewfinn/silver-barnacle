# Communicating the Status of Testing
There is no best way to communicate testing status to stakeholders.
* It depends on:
* Test management concerns
* Organisational test strategies
* Regulatory standards
* The team (in self-organising teams)

## Forms of Communication of the Test Status
* Verbal communication
* Dashboards
* Electronic communication channels
* Online documentation
* Formal test reports:
  * Test Progress Reports
  * Test Completion reports

Information reported and the degree of formality greatly depends on audience

## Monitoring & Communication in Agile
* Agile teams progress by having working software at the end of each iteration.
  * Need to monitor the progress of all work items in the iteration and release.
* Testers in Agile teams utilize various methods to record test progress and status:
  * Test automation results
  * Progression of test tasks and stories on the Agile task board
  * Burndown charts showing the teamâ€™s progress.
  * These can then be communicated using media such as wiki dashboards and dashboard-style emails, as well as verbally
* Agile teams may use tools that automatically generate status reports based on test results and task progress, which in turn update wiki-style dashboards and emails. This method of communication also gathers metrics from the testing process, which can be used in process improvement.
* Communicating test status in an automated manner also frees testersâ€™ time to focus on designing and executing more test cases.
