# Black-Box Test Techniques

* Aka **specification-based** techniques
* Based on an analysis of the specified behaviour of the test object
* View the test object (software under test) as black box with inputs/outputs without looking at how the system or component is structured inside the box
* Does **NOT** take the internal structure into account
* Test cases are independent of the way the software is implemented
* If the implementation changes, the test cases are still valid
* Functional and non-functional

### Characteristics

* Test conditions, test cases and test data are derived from a test basis that may include
  * Software requirement
  * Specifications
  * Use cases
  * User stories
* Test cases may be used to detect gaps between requirements and the implementation of the requirements as well as deviations from the requirements
* Coverage is measured based on the items tested in the test basis and the technique applied to the test basis
