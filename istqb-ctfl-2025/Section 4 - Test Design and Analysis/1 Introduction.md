# Introduction
## Testing Techniques

### General
* **Test Analysis** = What to Test
* **Test Design** = How to Test
* Test techniques help the tester in:
  * Defining **Test Conditions**
  * Identifying **Coverage items**
  * Identifying **Test Data**
* Test techniques help to create a small, but sufficient number of test cases in a systematic way
* Use of test techniques can vary from very formal to very informal
* Formality depends on context, test maturity and development maturity, time constraints, type of SDLC, safety and regulatory requirements, knowledge and skills of the people involved
