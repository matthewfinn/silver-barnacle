# Experience Based Test Techniques

* Leverage the experience, knowledge and intuition of the testers to design and implement tests
* Effectiveness heavily depends on the skills and experience of the tester
* Experience-based testing can find defects that could be missed by more formal test techniques (black-box and white-box)
* Often compliment white-box and black-box test techniques

### Characteristics

* Test conditions, test cases and test data are derived from a test basis that may include:
  * Knowledge and expertise of:
    * Testers
    * Developers
    * Users
    * Other Stakeholders
* Knowledge Includes:
  * The expected use of the software
  * Its environment
  * Likely defects and the distribution of defects
* Based on knowledge, experience, imagination and intuition
* Some defects are hard to find using more systematic approaches
* Should in general be used as a compliment to more formal techniques
* Effectiveness and coverage purely depends on the testersâ€™ approach and experience
* Coverage can be difficult to assess and may not be measurable
