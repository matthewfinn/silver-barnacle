# Experience Based Test Techniques

* Leverage the experience, knowledge & intuition of the testers to design & implement tests
* Effectiveness heavily depends on the skills & experience of the tester
* Experience-based testing can find defects that could be missed by more formal test techniques (black-box & white-box)
* Often compliment white-box & black-box test techniques

### Characteristics

* Test conditions, test cases & test data are derived from a test basis that may include:
  * Knowledge & expertise of:
    * Testers
    * Developers
    * Users
    * Other Stakeholders
* Knowledge Includes:
  * The expected use of the software
  * Its environment
  * Likely defects & the distribution of defects
* Based on knowledge, experience, imagination & intuition
* Some defects are hard to find using more systematic approaches
* Should in general be used as a compliment to more formal techniques
* Effectiveness & coverage purely depends on the testersâ€™ approach & experience
* Coverage can be difficult to assess & may not be measurable
