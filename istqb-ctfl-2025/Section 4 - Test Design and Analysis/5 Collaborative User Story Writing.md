### User Story Writing â€“ 3C Concept
**Card** â€“ Simple card or other medium accurately describing the user story

**Conversation** â€“ Explains how the software will be used and can be documented or verbal. 
Begins during release-planning and continue while the story is scheduled to be picked up.

**Confirmation** â€“ Acceptance criteria are used to confirm whether a story is done and may concern multiple user stories. 
Tests should include positive and negative scenarios. Various participants play the role of tester (dev, specialists, testers, etc)

  * Contradictory features
  * Miscommunications
  * Misinterpretations

**How can you build a solution to a problem when the problem is not clear?**

* User stories are captured and acceptance criteria defined from different perspectives:
  * Developers
  * Testers 
  * Business Representatives
* Shared vision through frequent informal reviews
* User stories should address functional and non-functional requirements
  * Acceptance criteria define when a feature is done

  Followed by the â€˜Acceptance Criteriaâ€™
