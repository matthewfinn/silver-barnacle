# generate_toc.js
### What This Does
1. Creates home.md (Table of Contents)
2. Adds "ðŸ”™ Home" to the top of each Markdown file
3. Prevents duplicate back links by removing old ones first
4. Encodes URLs correctly (fixing spaces in links)
5. Sorts everything alphabetically

### How to Use It
1. Save the script as generate_toc.js
2. Run it `node generate_toc.js`

### Automate it - NEEDS TESTING
1. Open the Git hooks directory:
```shell
cd your-repo/.git/hooks
```
2. Create/Edit `post-commit` hook
```shell
notepad post-commit
```
3. Add the below script
```shell
#!/bin/sh
node istqb-ctfl-2025/generate_toc.js
git add istqb-ctfl-2025/.
git commit --amend --no-edit
```
#### Not sure this is necessary
4. Make it executable
```shell
chmod +x post-commit
```
