# ISTQB Foundation Level Study Notes

## Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Testing

### Summary:
- **Why testing is necessary:** To reduce risk, improve quality, and detect defects early.
- **What is testing:** A process, not just execution. Includes planning, analysis, design, and reporting.
- **Seven Testing Principles:**
    1. Testing shows presence of defects, not their absence.
    2. Exhaustive testing is impossible.
    3. Early testing saves time and money.
    4. Defect clustering (Pareto Principle).
    5. Pesticide paradox.
    6. Testing is context dependent.
    7. Absence-of-errors fallacy.

- **Test Process Steps:**
    - Test planning
    - Test monitoring and control
    - Test analysis
    - Test design
    - Test implementation
    - Test execution
    - Test completion

### Quick Questions:
- Why can't we test everything?
- Whatâ€™s the pesticide paradox?
- Why is early testing important?
- What are the stages in the test process?

## Chapter 2: Testing Throughout the Software Development Lifecycle

### Summary:
- Testing activities vary depending on the **SDLC model**.
- **V-Model:** Testing phases mirror dev phases.
- **Agile:** Continuous testing, short iterations.
- **Testing Levels:**
    - Unit/Component Testing
    - Integration Testing
    - System Testing
    - Acceptance Testing

- **Testing Types:**
    - Functional vs Non-functional
    - Maintenance Testing

### Quick Questions:
- What are the four levels of testing?
- How does testing differ in Agile vs V-Model?
- Whatâ€™s the difference between functional and non-functional testing?

---

## Chapter 3: Static Testing

### Summary:
- Testing without executing code.
- **Static Techniques:**
    - Reviews (informal, walkthroughs, inspections)
    - Static analysis tools (e.g., code analysis)

- **Benefits:** Early defect detection, saves time and cost.

### Quick Questions:
- Whatâ€™s the main benefit of static testing?
- What are the types of reviews?
- How does static testing differ from dynamic testing?

---

## Chapter 4: Test Techniques

### Summary:
- **Black-box techniques:**
    - Equivalence partitioning
    - Boundary value analysis
    - Decision tables
    - State transition testing
    - Use case testing

- **White-box techniques:**
    - Statement coverage
    - Decision/branch coverage

- **Experience-based techniques:**
    - Error guessing
    - Exploratory testing

### Quick Questions:
- Whatâ€™s the difference between black-box and white-box testing?
- How does equivalence partitioning work?
- When would you use exploratory testing?

---

## Chapter 5: Test Management

### Summary:
- **Test Planning:** What to test, when, who, how.
- **Entry/Exit Criteria:** Conditions to start/end testing.
- **Test Monitoring:** Progress tracking (metrics, KPIs).
- **Risk-Based Testing:** Prioritize testing based on risk level.

- **Roles and Responsibilities:** Test manager vs tester

### Quick Questions:
- Whatâ€™s the purpose of test entry and exit criteria?
- How is risk-based testing used?
- What goes into a test plan?

---

## Chapter 6: Tools Support for Testing

### Summary:
- **Tool categories:**
    - Test management tools
    - Test execution tools
    - Static analysis tools
    - Performance testing tools
    - Defect tracking tools

- **Tool benefits:** Consistency, repeatability, saving time.

- **Risks:** Over-reliance, tool misfit, resistance from team.

- **Tool introduction process:**
    - Pilot projects
    - Gradual rollout
    - Training

### Quick Questions:
- What are the benefits and risks of test tools?
- Name three types of test tools.
- Whatâ€™s important when introducing a new tool?
