# Test Activities & Testware

### Test Process

* Set of common test activities
* Test strategy should state test process followed
* Not having common test activities = less likely to reach the test objectives
* Decisions on Test Activities are made in Test Planning
* In order to be effective, the need to be fully integrated with development activities

**The essential goal is not to find bugs, but to help fulfill the stakeholderâ€™s business needs**

### Test Process in Context

* Test Strategy
* Test Techniques used
* Degree of Test Automation
* Required Level of Coverage
* Level of Detail of Test Documentation
* Reporting

### Testware

Artifacts produced during the test process required to plan, design, & execute tests, such as documentation, scripts, inputs, expected results, set-up & clean-up procedures, files, databases, environment, & any additional software or utilities used in testing.

* Created as part of the test activities in the test process
* Each test activity creates test work products (aka testware)
* Types of work products vary as the test process varies
* Much testware can be captured & managed using
  * Test Management Tools
  * Defect Management Tools

Proper Configuration Management should be in place to ensure thorough & consistent testware

## Test Activities & Testware - Test Planning

### Test Planning â€“ Test Activities & Tasks

* Define objectives of testing
* Selecting approach that best achieves objectives
* Starts at the beginning of the software development project
* Must regularly be checked & may be updated & adjusted based on feedback from the monitoring & control activities

### Test Planning â€“ Testware

* Test Plan(s)
* Includes Information on
  * Test Basis e.g. requirements documents, design specifications, user stories, or even code itself
  * Traceability information
  * Exit Criteria (that's used in test monitoring & control)

## Test Activities & Testware - Test Monitoring & Control
### Test Monitoring & Control - Test Activities & Tasks
#### Test Monitoring
* **Ongoing** check of all test activities
* **Ongoing** comparison of actual progress vs the test plan using metrics

#### Test Control
* Taking actions needed to meet the objectives of testing
* Updating the Test Plan according to feedback

#### Monitoring & Control are supported by the evaluation of exit criteria (definition of done), which may include:
* Checking of test results & logs against coverage criteria
* Assessing component or system quality based on the test results & logs
* Determining if more tests are needed

**Progress, deviations & information needed to determine to stop testing is reported in Test Progress Reports, Documentation of Control Directives & Risk information**

### Test Monitoring & Control - Testware
* Various type of **Test Reports** such as:
  * Test Progress Reports
  * Test Summary Reports
  * Documentation of Control Directives
  * Risk Information
* These reports provide relevant information on the test progress & a summary of test execution results 

### Test Progress Report â€“ ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119 Standard

| Planned testing                |

## Test Activities & Testware - Test Analysis
### Test Analysis - Test Activities & Tasks
* Answers "what to test?" using measurable coverage criteria
* Major activities are:

  1. Analysing the test basis to:
     * Identify testable features
     * Test basis include Requirement Specifications, Design & Implementation information, implementation of the component itself, Risk Analysis reports, etc.
  
  2. Evaluating the Test Basis & test objects to identify defects & their testability such as:
     * Ambiguities
     * Omissions
     * Inconsistencies
     * Inaccuracies
     * Contradictions
     * Redundant statements
     
  3. Defining & Prioritising test conditions, their risks & risk levels per feature based on:
     * Analysis of the Test Basis
     * Consideration on functional, non-functional & structural characteristics
     * Business & technical factors
     * Levels of risk

     Black Box, White Box & Experience Based test techniques can be useful in Test Analysis to define more precise & accurate test conditions & not miss important test conditions

### Test Analysis - Testware
* Defined & prioritised test conditions (such as Acceptance Criteria)
* Defect reports regarding defects in the test basis

## Test Activities & Testware - Test Design
### Test Design - Test Activities & Tasks
* The test conditions are used to create high level test cases & other testware, often involving test design techniques
* Answers "How to test?"
* Includes the following major activities:
  * Identify coverage items
  * Designing test cases & sets of test cases
  * Defining the test data requirements to support test cases
  * Designing the test environment
  * Identifying required infrastructure & tools
* Identification of defects during Test Design is a potential benefit

#### A good test case is:
* Effective - finds faults
* Exemplary - represents others
* Evolvable - easy to maintain
* Economic - cheap to use

#### Abstract (logical) vs Concrete test cases
**Example:**
* Application for calculating end-of-year bonuses
* Bonuses depend on the time employees work for the company

  |Time at Company|Bonus|
  |--|--|
  |Less than 3 years|0%|
  |More than 3 years|50%|
  |More than 5 years|75%|
  |More than 8 years|100%|

**Abstract (logical) test case**

|Test Case #|Input x (time in company|Bonus|
|-|-|-|
|1|x<=3|0|
|2|3<x<=5|50|
|3|5<x<=8|75|
|4|x>8|100|

**Concrete test case**

|Test Case #|Input x (time in company|Bonus|
|-|-|-|
|1|2|0|
|2|4|50|
|3|7|75|
|4|12|100|

### Test Design - Testware
* Prioritised test cases & sets of test cases
* Other work products may include:
  * Test Charters
  * Coverage Items
  * Test environment requirements
  * Test data requirements
* Good practice to first design high level (abstract) test cases:
  * Without concrete values for input & expected output
  * Can be reused across multiple test cycles with different data
* Each test case should be bi-directionally traceable to the test conditions it covers
