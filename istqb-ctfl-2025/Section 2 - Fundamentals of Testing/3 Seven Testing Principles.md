# Seven Testing Principles

1. Testing shows presence of defects, not their absence
2. Exhaustive testing is impossible
3. Early testing saves time & money
4. Defect cluster together
5. Pesticide Paradox â€“ Tests wear out
6. Testing is context dependent
7. Absence-of-errors fallacy

### Testing shows presence of defects, not their absence
Testing reduces the probability of undiscovered defects remaining in the software but, even if no defects are found, 
this is not a proof of correctness. 

### Exhaustive testing is impossible
Testing everything (all combinations of inputs&preconditions) is not feasible.
Instead, risk analysis&priorities should be used to focus testing efforts

**Example**
* A simple 20 screen application with 3 menus&3 options per menu
* There are 12 fields per screen, 2 types of input (number as integer or
decimal)&about 120 possible values.
* How many tests would be needed for exhaustive testing? 
* Total tests for exhaustive testing: 20 x 3 x 3 x 12 x 2 x 120 = 518.400 tests
* If each tests takes 1 second, exhaustive testing takes 8.640 minutes, 144
hours, 18 working days 

### Early testing saves time & money
To find defects early, testing activities should be started as early as possible in the software development lifecycle.
and should be focused on defined objectives

### Defect cluster together
Testing effort should be focused proportionally to the expected & later observed defect density of modules.

### Pesticide Paradox â€“ Tests wear out
If the same tests are repeated over & over again, they will no longer find any new defects. 
To overcome this test cases need to be reviewed & revised, to exercise different parts of the software.

### Testing is context dependent
Testing is done differently in different contexts. For example, safety-critical software is tested differently from an e-commerce site 
and Agile testing differs from sequential testing.

### Absence-of-errors fallacy
Finding & fixing defects does not help if the system built is unusable & does not fulfill the users needs & expectations. 
Besides verification, validation should also be done.
