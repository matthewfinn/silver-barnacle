## Download Simka App

[Install iOS Build](https://help.testlio.com/en/articles/5734246-download-install-ios-builds)

The IPA build can only be downloaded once your Test Run has started on the scheduled start time. Once the Run starts:

1. Open the Testlio Platform directly on the browser of your iOS device.
2. Open the workspace homepage and start the Test Run.
3. Observe the flow to reach the Build Setup page.
4. Download the build directly on your iPhone.
5. Make sure to mark the app you are testing as a trusted developer in the settings (shown in the video below) before opening the app.
   a. For newer iOS versions (iOS 16.0 and further)  iPhone prompts a developer mode warning. In this case you need to Go to settings -> Privacy & security -> Developer Mode -> Turn on.

   **Above step did not work for me**
1. Tap Settings > General > VPN & Device Management.
2. In the Enterprise App section, tap the name of the app developer.
3. Tap Trust "[developer name]" to continue. In iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and visionOS 2 and later, tap "Allow & Restart" to proceed with establishing trust. In earlier software versions, tap Trust to establish trust.
4. After your device restarts, follow the onscreen instructions to complete the process and trust the developer.
