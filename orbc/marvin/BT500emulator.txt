BT500 emulator setup notes

Create android 10 emulator
Install Infrastructure - need a branch to fix comms issues for android 10 refactor
Connect to emulators own wifi network - no 
mock_bt500 node service - mocks responses from BT500 - config.js has vehicle details - copy auth from DB for first Pair 
MantleRootUrl http://10.0.2.2:8080 - host machine IP to contact local nginx instance for mantle and bt500 calls
node ./server.js to run mock_bt500

-- Comment from Eoin
$ npm install
$ node ./server.js
 
Will hopefully get you started
