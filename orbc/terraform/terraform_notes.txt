It doesn't look like any QA machine has an old enough Windows server version (2012 seems to be the max) to install an IIS version thats compatible with FMAPI (needs to be IIS 6, 7 or 8).
A way around this might be to test using the FMAPI instance on testing-ah, but

 that's only accessible on the office network
