# Chapter 1 - Introduction to Chai
[Chai Assertion Library](https://www.chaijs.com/)

Chai is an assertion library for JavaScript frameworks.

Assert statements are used to make sure that the assumptions and actual results of the function are exactly same.

We need a lot of assertions in our test to make sure that the actual result is same as the expected one or 
that meets the acceptance criteria of the test.

Chai's interfaces are broadly classified into two: TDD styles and BDD styles.

|**BDD**| **TDD**   |
