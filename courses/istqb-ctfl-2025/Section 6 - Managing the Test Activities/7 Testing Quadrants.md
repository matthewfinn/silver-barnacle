# Testing Quadrants
* Group the test levels with the appropriate:
  * Test Types
  * Test Levels
  * Activities
  * Test techniques
  * Work Products
* Support test management with visualisation to:
  * Ensure that the appropriate test types & test levels are included in the SDLC
  * Understand that some test types are more relevant to certain test levels than others
* Provide a way to differentiate & describe the types of tests to stakeholders

**Tech helps â†’ Quadrant 1 â†’ "Fix the code"**
**Business helps â†’ Quadrant 2 â†’ "Meets business needs?"**
**Business critiques â†’ Quadrant 3 â†’ "User feedback?"**
**Tech critiques â†’ Quadrant 4 â†’ "Stress test and secure it"**

Here's a brief overview of the four quadrants:

**Quadrant 1: Technology-Facing, Supporting the Team (Unit Testing)**
  * **Focus:** Low-level tests that ensure the software works correctly at the code level.
  * **Examples:** Unit tests, component tests, and integration tests.
  * **Purpose:** To support the development team by identifying bugs and issues early in the development process.

**Quadrant 2: Business-Facing, Supporting the Team (Functional Testing)**
  * **Focus:** Testing that ensures the functionality of the software meets business requirements.
  * **Examples:** System Level, Functional Tests, API Tests, Story Tests, Simulations
  * **Purpose:** To help the team ensure that the software behaves as expected from a business perspective.

**Quadrant 3: Business-Facing, Criticizing the Product (User Experience, Usability Testing)**
  * **Focus:** Testing that evaluates how well the product meets user needs and provides a positive experience.
  * **Examples:** Usability testing, UAT, Alpha & Beta testing, System or Acceptance level, 
  * **Purpose:** To critique the software from a business/customer perspective, ensuring it aligns with the intended user experience.

**Quadrant 4: Technology-Facing, Criticizing the Product (Performance, Security Testing)**
  * **Focus:** Testing that examines the technical qualities of the software, such as performance, security, and scalability.
  * **Examples:** Load testing, performance testing, security testing, and stress testing.
  * **Purpose:** To evaluate the softwareâ€™s technical aspects and identify potential issues that may affect its robustness or security.
