# generate_toc.js
### What This Does
1. Creates home.md (Table of Contents)
2. Adds "ðŸ”™ Home" to the top of each Markdown file
3. Prevents duplicate back links by removing old ones first
4. Encodes URLs correctly (fixing spaces in links)
5. Sorts everything alphabetically

### How to Use It
1. Save the script as generate_toc.js
2. Run it `node generate_toc.js`

### Automate it
1. Open the Git hooks directory:
```shell
cd your-repo/.git/hooks
```
2. Create/Edit `post-commit` hook
```shell
echo post-commit
```
3. Add the below script
```shell
#!/bin/sh

# Get the latest commit message
latest_commit_message=$(git log -1 --pretty=%B)

# Check if the commit message already contains the " - amended by TOC script" suffix
if echo "$latest_commit_message" | grep -q " - amended by TOC script"; then
    echo "Commit already amended by TOC script. Exiting to prevent infinite loop."
    exit 0
fi

# Run the node script to generate the TOC
node istqb-ctfl-2025/generate_toc.js

# Add all changes to the staging area
git add .

# Amend the commit without changing the commit message, but add " - amended by TOC script" to prevent looping
git commit --amend --no-edit -m "$(git log -1 --pretty=%B) - amended by TOC script"
```
