# System Testing
* Focuses on the behaviour & capabilities of a whole system or product
* Looks at the functional end-to-end tasks the system can perform & the non-functional behaviour when performing these tasks
* Automated system regression tests provide confidence
* Often produces information for the stakeholders to make release decisions
* May also satisfy legal or regulatory standards or requirements
* Test environment should be as close as possible to the production environment spec

### Objectives
* Reducing risk
* Verifying whether the functional & non-functional behaviour of the system is as designed & specified
* Validating that the system is complete & will work as expected
* Building confidence in the quality of the system as a whole
* Finding defects
* Preventing defects from getting into higher test levels or production
* In some cases â€“ verifying data quality

### Test Basis
* System & software requirement
* Risk Analysis reports
* Use cases
* Epics & user stories
* Models of system behaviour
* State diagrams
* System & user manuals

### Test Object
* Applications
* Hardware/Software systems
* Operating systems
* System under test (SUT)
* System configuration & configuration data

### Typical Defects & Failures
* Incorrect calculations
* Incorrect or unexpected functional or non-functional system behaviour
* Incorrect control or data flows within the system
* Failure to properly & completely carry out end-to-end functionality
* Failure of the system to work properly in the production environment
* Failure of the system to work as described in the system & user manuals

### Approach & Responsibilities
* Should focus on the overall, end-to-end behaviour of the system as a whole
* Includes **functional** & **non-functional**
* Can be tested using specification-based techniques (black box) or structure-based techniques (white-box)
* Typically performed by independent testers
* Specification defects can lead to misunderstanding of expected system behaviour, which can lead to false positives or false negatives
* Early involvement of testers reduces the risk of above situations occurring

### Examples
* E-commerce Platform â€“ Testing the full system workflow, including browsing products, adding to cart, checking out, & receiving an order confirmation email.
* Banking Application â€“ Ensuring all system functionalities like fund transfers, account statements, & loan applications work as expected.
* Airline Booking System â€“ Testing the entire booking process, from searching flights to payment processing & ticket generation.
* POS System in Retail â€“ Testing a storeâ€™s point-of-sale system, ensuring it correctly processes transactions, updates inventory, & prints receipts.
