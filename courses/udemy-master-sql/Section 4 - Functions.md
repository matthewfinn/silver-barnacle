## LENGTH, LOWER & UPPER
### Syntax & Examples
```sql
SELECT 
UPPER(email) AS email_upper,
LOWER(email) AS email_lower,
LENGTH(email) AS email_length
FROM customer
```

```sql
SELECT 
UPPER(email) AS email_upper,
LOWER(email) AS email_lower,
LENGTH(email) AS email_length
FROM customer
WHERE LENGTH(email) < 30
```

### Coding Exercise 16: LENGTH, LOWER & UPPER
Write a SQL query to find all reviews for ``product_id = 101`` where the review text contains the word "great" (case insensitive), and order the results by the length of the review text (from shortest to longest).

Return the ``review_id``, ``review_text``, and the length of the ``review_text`` (use alias ``review_length``).#

**Relevant table:**
``customer_reviews``


```sql
SELECT 
review_id,
review_text,
LENGTH(review_text) AS review_length
FROM customer_reviews
WHERE product_id = 101
AND LOWER(review_text) LIKE '%great%'
ORDER BY LENGTH(review_text) ASC
```

### Challenge: LENGTH, LOWER & UPPER
> In the email system there was a problem with names where either the first name or the last name is more than 10 characters long.
Find these customers and output the list of these first and last names in all lower case.

**Solution**
```sql
SELECT 
LOWER(first_name),
LOWER(last_name),
LOWER(email)
FROM customer
WHERE LENGTH(first_name) > 10 
OR LENGTH(last_name) > 10
```

### Coding Exercise 17: Concatenate
Write a single SQL query to concatenate the product name, category, and price into a single string for each product, formatted as: ``Product Name - Category: Price``. 
Use alias AS _product_summary_. Ensure the price is prefixed with a dollar sign ($), e.g. $1.99. 
Order the results by the product name in ascending order.

**Available columns:** `product_id`, `name`, `category`, and `price` from the `products` table.

```sql
SELECT
name || ' - ' || category || ': ' || '$' || price AS product_summary
FROM products
ORDER BY name ASC
```

### Challenge: Concatenate
> You need to create an anonymized form of the email addresses in the following way:
>       `M***@sakilacustomer.org`
> It should be the first character followed by "***" and then the last part starting with "@"
> Note that the email address always ends with 'sakilacustomer.org'


**Solution:**
```sql
SELECT LEFT(email, 1) || '***' || RIGHT(email, 19),
email
FROM customer
```

## POSITION

**Search for another column value i.e. search for last name to get first name**
```sql
SELECT
email,
LEFT(email, POSITION(last_name IN email) - 2)
FROM customer
```

Output:
| email                               | left     |

> * What's the month with the highest total payment amount?
> * What's the day of week with the highest total payment amount? (0 is Sunday)
> * What's the highest amount one customer has spent in a week?

**Solution 1:**
```sql

SUM(amount) AS total_payment_amount
FROM payment
GROUP BY month_number
ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC
LIMIT 1
```
**Solution 2:**

FROM payment
GROUP BY dayofweek
ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC
LIMIT 1
```
**Solution 3:**
```sql
SELECT 
customer_id,
EXTRACT(week FROM payment_date) AS weekofyr,
SUM(amount)
FROM payment
GROUP BY weekofyr, customer_id
ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC
LIMIT 1
```

```sql
SELECT
TO_CHAR(rental_date, 'MM-YYYY')
FROM rental
```

**Get MM/YYYY Format**
```sql
SELECT
TO_CHAR(rental_date, 'MM/YYYY Day')
FROM rental
```

**Day DD Month YYYY Format**
```sql
SELECT
TO_CHAR(rental_date, 'Day DD Month YYYY')
FROM rental

**GROUP BY Formatted**
```sql
SELECT
SUM(amount),
TO_CHAR(payment_date, 'Day, Month YYYY')
FROM payment
GROUP BY TO_CHAR(payment_date, 'Day, Month YYYY')
```

### Challenge: TO_CHAR
>You need to sum payments and group in the following formats:
![img18.png](assets/img18.png)

**Solution 1:**
```sql
SELECT
SUM(amount) as total_amount,
TO_CHAR(payment_date, 'Dy, DD/MM/YYYY') as "day"
FROM payment
GROUP BY "day"
ORDER BY total_amount DESC
```

**Solution 2:**
```sql
SELECT
SUM(amount) as total_amount,
TO_CHAR(payment_date, 'Mon, YYYY') as "month"
FROM payment
GROUP BY "month"
ORDER BY total_amount DESC
```

**Solution 3:**

FROM rental
```

**How many hours a rental lasted**
```sql
SELECT
rental_date,
EXTRACT(day from return_date - rental_date)*24 + EXTRACT(hour from return_date - rental_date) || ' hours'
FROM rental
WHERE return_date is not NULL
order by rental_date desc
```
