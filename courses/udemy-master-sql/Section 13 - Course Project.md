# Section 13: Course Project
* All using local database called `greencycles`
* * &#9989; = correct, &#10060; = incorrect - marked beside _My Solution_ for each question


## Task 1 - Create Tables
**Difficulty:** Moderate

### Task 1.1
In your company there hasn't been a database table with all the employee information yet.
You need to set up the table called `employees` in the following way:

![img55.png](assets/img55.png)

There should be `NOT NULL` constraints for the following columns:
* `first_name`
* `last_name` 
* `job_position`
* `start_date DATE`
* `birth_date DATE`

**My Solution:** &#9989;
```sql
CREATE TABLE employees(
    emp_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    last_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    job_position TEXT NOT NULL,
    salary DECIMAL(8,2),
    start_date DATE NOT NULL,
    birth_date DATE NOT NULL,
    store_id INT REFERENCES store(store_id),
    department_id INT,
    manager_id INT
);
```
### Task 1.2
Set up an additional table called `departments` in the following way:
![img56.png](assets/img56.png)
Additionally no column should allow nulls.

**My Solution:** &#9989;
```sql
CREATE TABLE departments(
    department_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    department TEXT NOT NULL,
    division TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

## Task 2 - Alter Tables
**Difficulty:** Moderate

Alter the employees table in the following way:
- Set the column `department_id` to not null.
- Add a default value of `CURRENT_DATE` to the column `start_date`.
- Add the column `end_date` with an appropriate data type (one that you think makes sense).
- Add a constraint called `birth_check` that doesn't allow birth dates that are in the future.
- Rename the column `job_position` to `position_title`.

**My Solution:** &#9989;
```sql
ALTER TABLE employees
ALTER COLUMN department_id SET NOT NULL,
ALTER COLUMN start_date SET DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS end_date DATE,
ADD CONSTRAINT birth_check CHECK(birth_date <= CURRENT_DATE)

-- Rename needs to be a seperate step
ALTER TABLE employees
RENAME COLUMN job_position TO position_title
```

## Task 3 - Insert Data
**Difficulty:** Moderate
### Task 3.1

Insert the following values into the employees table.

There will be most likely an error when you try to insert the values.

So, try to insert the values and then fix the error.

Columns:
```sql
(emp_id,first_name,last_name,position_title,salary,start_date,birth_date,store_id,department_id,manager_id,end_date)
```

Values:

|round|
|-----|
|8834.75|

## Task 5 - Create View
**Difficulty:** Advanced

### Task 5.1
1. Write a query that adds a column called `manager` that contains  `first_name` and `last_name` (in one column) in the data output.
2. Secondly, add a column called `is_active` with `false` if the employee has left the company already, otherwise the value is `true`.

**My Solution:** &#9989;
```sql
SELECT 
emp.*,
CASE WHEN emp.end_date IS NULL THEN 'true'
ELSE 'false' 
END as is_active,
mng.first_name ||' '|| mng.last_name AS manager_name
FROM employees emp
LEFT JOIN employees mng
ON emp.manager_id=mng.emp_id;
```

### Task 5.2

CREATE VIEW v_employees_info
AS SELECT 
emp.*,
CASE WHEN emp.end_date IS NULL THEN 'true'
ELSE 'false' 
END as is_active,
mng.first_name ||' '|| mng.last_name AS manager_name
FROM employees emp
LEFT JOIN employees mng
ON emp.manager_id=mng.emp_id;
```

## Task 6 - Query Averages Per Role Title

```sql
SELECT 
division,
ROUND(AVG(salary), 2)
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments
ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id
GROUP BY division
```
Output:
|division|round|
|--------|-----|

6107.41

## Task 8 - Window Functions/Correlated Subqueries
**Difficulty:** Advanced

### Task 8.1
Write a query that returns the following:

* emp_id,
* first_name,
* last_name,
* position_title,
* salary
* and a column that returns the average salary for every position_title.

Order the results by the `emp_id`.
![img58.webp](assets/img58.webp)

**My Solution:** &#9989;
```sql
SELECT 
emp_id,
first_name,
last_name,
position_title,
salary,
ROUND((SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees e2
	WHERE e1.position_title = e2.position_title), 2)
FROM employees e1
ORDER BY emp_id
```

**Course Solution:**
```sql
SELECT
emp_id,
first_name,
last_name,
position_title,
salary,
ROUND(AVG(salary) OVER(PARTITION BY position_title),2) as avg_position_sal
FROM employees
ORDER BY 1;
```

### Task 8.2
**Difficulty:** Advanced to Pro
How many people earn less than there avg_position_salary?
Write a query that answers that question.
Ideally, the output just shows that number directly.

**My Solution:** &#9989;
```sql
SELECT 
COUNT(*)
FROM employees e1
WHERE salary < 
   (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees e2
   WHERE e1.position_title = e2.position_title)
```
Answer:
9

## Task 9 - Window Function
**Difficulty:** Advanced

Write a query that returns a running total of the salary development by the start_date.

In your calculation, you can assume their salary has not changed over time, and you can disregard the fact that people have left the company (write the query as if they were still working for the company).

![img59.webp](assets/img59.webp)

**My Solution:** &#9989;
```sql
SELECT 
emp_id,
salary,
start_date,
SUM(salary) OVER(ORDER BY start_date) AS running_total
FROM employees
```
Output:
|emp_id|salary   |start_date|running_total|
|------|---------|----------|-------------|
|11    |3060.00  |2013-09-06|166413.08    |
|18    |6335.62  |2014-09-24|172748.70    |
|22    |1036.00  |2016-03-18|173784.70    |
|24    |6418.00  |2018-12-31|180202.70    |
|9     |4937.00  |2019-03-22|185139.70    |
|2     |14614.00 |2019-07-23|199753.70    |


Question:
What was the total salary after 2018-12-31?

Answer:
180202.70

## Task 10 - Window Function & Unions
**Difficulty**: Pro / Very difficult
Create the same running total but now also consider the fact that people were leaving the company.

Note:
>This challenge is actually very difficult.
Don't worry if you can't solve it you are not expected to do so.
It is possible to solve the challenge even without the hints.
If you want you can try to solve it using the hints and it is still a difficult challenge.

Hints:
* Use the view v_employees_info.
* Create two separate queries: one with all employees and one with the people that have already left
* In the first query use start_date and in the second query use end_date instead of the start_date
* Multiply the salary of the second query with (-1).
* Create a subquery from that UNION and use a window function in that to create the running total.

**My Solution:** &#9989;
```sql
SELECT 
start_date,
SUM(salary) OVER(ORDER BY start_date)
FROM (
	SELECT 
	emp_id,
	salary,
	start_date
	FROM employees
	UNION 
	SELECT 
	emp_id,
	salary * -1,
	end_date
	FROM v_employees_info
	WHERE is_active ='false'
	ORDER BY start_date) 
```
Question:
What was the total salary after 2018-12-31?

Answer:
166802.84

**Course Solution:**
```sql
SELECT 
start_date,
SUM(salary) OVER(ORDER BY start_date)
FROM (
SELECT 
emp_id,
salary,
start_date
FROM employees
UNION 
SELECT 
emp_id,
-salary,
end_date
FROM v_employees_info
WHERE is_active ='false'
ORDER BY start_date) a 
```

## Task 11 - Ranking & Correlated Subqueries
**Difficulty:** Advanced to Pro

### Task 11.1

Write a query that outputs only the top earner per position_title including first_name and position_title and their salary.

![img60.webp](assets/img60.webp)

**My Solution:** &#9989;
```sql
SELECT first_name, position_title, salary FROM(
	SELECT
	first_name,
	position_title,
	salary,
	RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY position_title ORDER BY SUM(salary)DESC) AS rank
	FROM employees
	GROUP BY first_name, position_title,salary
) WHERE rank = 1

```
Output:
|first_name|position_title|salary    |
|----------|--------------|----------|

## Task 12 - Grouping Sets
**Difficulty:** Pro

Write a query that returns all meaningful aggregations of
- sum of salary,
- number of employees,
- average salary

grouped by all meaningful combinations of
- division
- department
- position_title

Consider the levels of hierarchies in a meaningful way.

**My Solution:** &#9989;
```sql
SELECT division, department, position_title, SUM(salary), COUNT(*),ROUND(AVG(salary),2) FROM employees e
NATURAL JOIN departments
GROUP BY
	GROUPING SETS(
		(division, department, position_title),
		(division, department),
		(division),
		()
	)
ORDER BY division, department, position_title
```
Output:
