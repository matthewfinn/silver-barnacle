# Section 16: CTEs (Common Table Expressions)

## What are CTEs?
A CTE is a temporary result set that you can reference within your query. 
CTEs make your SQL queries more readable and easier to manage, especially when dealing with complex joins and subqueries.

**Here’s why CTEs are useful:**

1. **Improves Readability**: They help break down complex queries into simpler, more understandable parts.
2. **Reusability**: You can reference the CTE multiple times within the same query, which avoids repetition of the same subquery.
3. **Modularity**: They allow for a modular approach to building queries, making it easier to debug and maintain.
4. **Recursive Queries**: CTEs support recursion, enabling you to write queries that deal with hierarchical or tree-structured data.
