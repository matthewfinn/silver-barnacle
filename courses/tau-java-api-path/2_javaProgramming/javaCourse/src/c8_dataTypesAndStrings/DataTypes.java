     * Dynamically typed programming languages determine the data type of a variable at runtime -
     * Therefore, in these types of languages the programmer doesn't need to specify the data type of a variable.
     *
     * Java is a statically typed programming language â€” which means, it expects its variables to be declared before they can be assigned values because,
     * in statically typed languages the data type is checked at compile time.
     *
     * TYPE INFERENCE
     * As of version 10 we can use var for inference
     * i.e. var grid = getGridArray
     *
     * Rules for Type Inference
     * 1. Only works for local variables
     * 2. Initialisation required
     * 3. Not allowed in headers (i.e. params or return types)
     *
     * PRIMATIVE DATA TYPE | WRAPPER CLASS
     * byte                  Byte
     * short                 Short
     * int                   Integer
     * long                  Long
     * float                 Float
     * double                Double
     * boolean               Boolean
     *
     * Wrapper classes make primative data type an Object!
     * More available operations!
