## Why Accessibility Testing is Important
**First of all, doing accessibility testing is just the right thing to do.**

We need to be empathetic to our users with disabilities and put ourselves in their shoes.
As more and more information can now be accessed online, we need to start thinking about how all of our users will use our products.
It’s important to include everyone and this not only benefits individuals, but the society as a whole.

**Better accessibility means better user experience.**

For example, If you are testing a website that has great design, animations and all these exciting features but poor accessibility, this leads to bad user experience.

**Better accessibility also means that you widen your reach to other audiences.**

## How Can Automated Accessibility Tests Help Us?
1. **Catch basic accessibility issues earlier**
By automating some of the accessibility tests, we can **catch basic accessibility issues earlier** on and allows us to collaborate more with our design and development team.

This can also serve as **living documentation** for your team.

For example, if your team is actively trying to reduce the number of accessibility issues your website has, having a dashboard which displays a report of the test run will serve as documentation and will make everyone aware of what issues are still outstanding.

2. **Prevent any regression issues related to accessibility**
It will prevent any regression issues related to accessibility from being deployed to production.
By having the automated tests in place, you have this safety net that issues your team have fixed in the past will not be deployed to production again since it’s now covered by an automated test.

It also frees up your time to do more complex testing activities, such as testing with screen readers or using the keyboard only to navigate a site.

3. **Provides a fast feedback loop to your design and development team**
Having automated accessibility tests provides a fast feedback loop to your design and development team, especially if the tests are running as part of your continuous integration pipeline. Your development team will know in an instant if the feature that they are working on has broken any accessibility rules. Likewise, if there are any color contrast errors that got detected, the design team can be informed if they need to amend any of the color tokens they’ve chosen.

## The Importance of doing Accessibility Testing with Actual Users
Nothing beats actual accessibility testing with real users.

There’s still a lot of benefit to gain if you invite real users with disabilities to test your website as they probably use different third party assistive technologies and this way, you have that first-hand understanding on how they use your product on a day-to-day basis.

They can provide valuable inputs on how to make your feature accessible.

W3C has provides an evaluation report generator that you can use for your evaluation.
