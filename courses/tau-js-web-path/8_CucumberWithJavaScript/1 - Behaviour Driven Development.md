# What is BDD?

* BDD stands for behaviour-driven development, and it's an **example-based** method for developing software.
* It includes many different collaborative activities & techniques performed by stakeholders; The Product Owner, The Developer & The Testers (often referred to as the **3 amigos**)
* One of the major activities is having the Three Amigos meet to discuss and document examples of how a system should act and be used. These examples describe how the software is intended to behave, often illustrating a particular business rule or requirement.
* **It's important to note that these examples do not outline how a system, or its features should be implemented, only how it should behave.**
* The end result of discussing and documenting these examples is that all parties should come to a mutual understanding of how the feature will behave in various scenarios, and by extension, how the system itself should work.
* **An important point to note is that BDD is not solely a testing technique.**
* Much like test-driven development, it's a process of approaching your design and forcing you to think about the desired outcome before you code.
* Test cases and eventually automated tests should be a byproduct of following a BDD approach and having great properly structured examples.

## BDD's Value
The major goals of BDD are to narrow the communication gaps among team members, foster a better understanding of the customer's needs, and promote continuous communication throughout the software development process.
* Collaboration
* Everyone speaks the same language
* Breakdown Silos
* Shared Understanding
* Examples can be used as executable artifacts that drive test automation

## BDD Terms
* **Three Amigos** refers to the main stakeholders in the software development process: product owner, tester, and developer.
* **Example-based** is an approach to software development that leverages the creation of examples to drive discussion, understanding, development, and testing.
* An **example** is a description of how the software is intended to behave, often illustrating a particular business rule or requirement.
**Gherkin** is a special syntax that should be used when developing examples. This is designed in a way for anyone to understand the behavior of a feature.
