# Chapter 1 - Variable & Data Types

## Chapter 1.1 - Variables

Declarations

```javascript
 let "create a variable and reassign the value"
 const "can't reassign value"
 var "legacy"
```

## Chapter 1.2 - JavaScript Data Types

### Strings

Strings are letters, numbers, emojis, and any type of character you see on the keyboard.

### Numbers

Numbers can be positive, negative whole numbers, or even be numbers with decimals.

### Booleans

Boolean - the boolean type is strictly true or false. That's it.

### Undefined vs. null

Undefined - Default value that gets assigned to a variable when you create it.

i.e.

```javascript
 let name;
```

Null - undefined usually means that there is no value. Null usually means that we are clearing out the value.
Just set values that you want to clear out to null and think about undefined being the default value when youcreate a variable but don't assign an initial value to it.

```javascript
name = null;
```
